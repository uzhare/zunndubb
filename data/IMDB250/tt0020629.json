The film follows a group of German schoolboys, talked into enlisting at the beginning of World War 1 by their jingoistic teacher. The story is told entirely through the experiences of the young German recruits and highlights the tragedy of war through the eyes of individuals. As the boys witness death and mutilation all around them, any preconceptions about \"the enemy\" and the \"rights and wrongs\" of the conflict disappear, leaving them angry and bewildered. This is highlighted in the scene where Paul mortally wounds a French soldier and then weeps bitterly as he fights to save his life while trapped in a shell crater with the body. The film is not about heroism but about drudgery and futility and the gulf between the concept of war and the actuality.", "runtime": ["UK: 145 min (cut)", "UK: 147 min (BBFC submission before censorship)", "Germany: 136 min", "USA: 133 min (restored version: Library of Congress)", "138 min (copyright length)", "Spain: 128 min (DVD edition)", "USA: 101 min (TV version)"], "poster": "http://img3.douban.com/lpic/s2012796.jpg", "imdb_url": "http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0020629/", "title": "All Quiet on the Western Front", "writers": ["Erich Maria Remarque", "Maxwell Anderson"], "imdb_id": "tt0020629", "directors": ["Lewis Milestone"], "rating_count": 33109, "actors": ["Louis Wolheim", "Lew Ayres", "John Wray", "Arnold Lucy", "Ben Alexander", "Scott Kolk", "Owen Davis Jr.", "Walter Rogers", "William Bakewell", "Russell Gleason", "Richard Alexander", "Harold Goodwin", "Slim Summerville", "G.
