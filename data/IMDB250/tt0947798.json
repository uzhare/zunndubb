She lives with her obsessive former ballerina mother Erica (Hershey) who exerts a suffocating control over her. When artistic director Thomas Leroy (Cassel) decides to replace prima ballerina Beth MacIntyre (Ryder) for the opening production of their new season, Swan Lake, Nina is his first choice. But Nina has competition: a new dancer, Lily (Kunis), who impresses Leroy as well. Swan Lake requires a dancer who can play both the White Swan with innocence and grace, and the Black Swan, who represents guile and sensuality. Nina fits the White Swan role perfectly but Lily is the personification of the Black Swan. As the two young dancers expand their rivalry into a twisted friendship, Nina begins to get more in touch with her dark side - a recklessness that threatens to destroy her.", "runtime": ["108 min"], "poster": "http://img3.douban.com/lpic/s4540404.jpg", "imdb_url": "http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0947798/", "title": "Black Swan", "writers": ["Mark Heyman", "Andres Heinz"], "imdb_id": "tt0947798", "directors": ["Darren Aronofsky"], "rating_count": 306419, "actors": ["Natalie Portman", "Mila Kunis", "Vincent Cassel", "Barbara Hershey", "Winona Ryder", "Benjamin Millepied", "Ksenia Solo", "Kristina Anapau", "Janet Montgomery", "Sebastian Stan", "Toby Hemingway", "Sergio Torrado", "Mark Margolis", "Tina Sloan", "Abraham Aronofsky"], "plot_simple": "A ballet dancer wins the lead in \"Swan Lake\" and is perfect for the role of the delicate White Swan - Princess Odette - but slowly loses her mind as she becomes more and more like Odile, the Black Swan.", "year": 2010, "country": ["USA"], "type": "M", "release_date": 20101217, "also_known_as": ["El cisne negro"]}
