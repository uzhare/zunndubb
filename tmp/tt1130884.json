He's been pushing for an assignment on the island for personal reasons, but before long he wonders whether he hasn't been brought there as part of a twisted plot by hospital doctors whose radical treatments range from unethical to illegal to downright sinister. Teddy's shrewd investigating skills soon provide a promising lead, but the hospital refuses him access to records he suspects would break the case wide open. As a hurricane cuts off communication with the mainland, more dangerous criminals \"escape\" in the confusion, and the puzzling, improbable clues multiply, Teddy begins to doubt everything - his memory, his partner, even his own sanity.", "runtime": ["138 min"], "poster": "http://img3.douban.com/lpic/s3895194.jpg", "imdb_url": "http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1130884/", "title": "Shutter Island", "writers": ["Laeta Kalogridis", "Dennis Lehane"], "imdb_id": "tt1130884", "directors": ["Martin Scorsese"], "rating_count": 346730, "actors": ["Leonardo DiCaprio", "Mark Ruffalo", "Ben Kingsley", "Max von Sydow", "Michelle Williams", "Emily Mortimer", "Patricia Clarkson", "Jackie Earle Haley", "Ted Levine", "John Carroll Lynch", "Elias Koteas", "Robin Bartlett", "Christopher Denham", "Nellie Sciutto", "Joseph Sikora"], "plot_simple": "Drama set in 1954, U.S. Marshal Teddy Daniels is investigating the disappearance of a murderess who escaped from a hospital for the criminally insane and is presumed to be hiding nearby.", "year": 2010, "country": ["USA"], "type": "M", "release_date": 20100219, "also_known_as": ["La isla siniestra"]}
