He finds many knights including Sir Galahad the pure, Sir Lancelot the brave, the quiet Sir Bedevere, and Sir Robin the Not-Quite-So-Brave-as-Sir Lancelot. They do not travel on horses, but pretend they do and have their servants bang coconuts to make the sound of horse's hooves. Through satire of certain events in history (witch trials, the black plague) they find Camelot, but after literally a quick song and dance they decide that they do not want to go there. While walking away, God (who seems to be grumpy) come to them from a cloud and tells them to find the Holy Grail. They agree and begin their search. While they search for the Grail, scenes of the knight's tales appear and why they have the name they have. Throughout their search they meet interesting people and knights along the way...", "runtime": ["91 min"], "poster": "http://img3.douban.com/lpic/s1317736.jpg", "imdb_url": "http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0071853/", "title": "Monty Python and the Holy Grail", "writers": ["Graham Chapman", "John Cleese"], "imdb_id": "tt0071853", "directors": ["Terry Gilliam", "Terry Jones"], "rating_count": 231809, "actors": ["Graham Chapman", "John Cleese", "Eric Idle", "Terry Gilliam", "Terry Jones", "Michael Palin", "Connie Booth", "Carol Cleveland", "Neil Innes", "Bee Duffell", "John Young", "Rita Davies", "Avril Stewart", "Sally Kinghorn", "Mark Zycon"], "plot_simple": "King Arthur and his knights embark on a low-budget search for the Grail, encountering many very silly obstacles.", "year": 1975, "country": ["UK"], "type": "M", "release_date": 19750525, "also_known_as": ["M\u00f8nti Pyth\u00f8n ik den H\u00f8li Gr\u00e4ilen"]}
