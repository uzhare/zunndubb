Every once in a while I will watch this film again and see if maybe I have grown tired of it.  Surely after \"Saving Private Ryan,\" \"Titanic,\" \"Crimes and Misdemeanors,\" or \"Schindler's List\" I have seen a better film.  Well, after every viewing there is something about Oliver Stone's masterpiece that keeps me saying that I have never seen anything better.I am a sucker for Vietnam pictures.  \"Apocalypse Now\" and \"The Deer Hunter\" also rank in my top ten of all time.  Stories about Vietnam can run the entire gambit of human emotions.  \"Platoon\" is not only a documentation of America's sordid involvement in a foreign civil war, it is also a dramatic story of human response.  A life developing in the most horrible of places.There have been films put together better.  There have been films with more detailed and interesting plots.  But none have ever told a more touching story of human development set in the backdrop of bloody violence and inhuman suffering.Rating: 10 out of 10.", "year": 1986, "country": ["UK", "USA"], "type": "M", "runtime": ["120 min"], "also_known_as": ["Pelot\u00f3n"]}
