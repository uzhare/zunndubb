The story opens with the death of Lawrence in a motorcycle accident in Dorset at the age of 46, then flashbacks to recount his adventures: as a young intelligence officer in Cairo in 1916, he is given leave to investigate the progress of the Arab revolt against the Turks in World War I. In the desert, he organizes a guerrilla army and--for two years--leads the Arabs in harassing the Turks with desert raids, train-wrecking and camel attacks. Eventually, he leads his army northward and helps a British General destroy the power of the Ottoman Empire.", "runtime": ["216 min", "UK: 228 min (director's cut)", "UK: 187 min (1970 re-release)", "UK: 210 min (original version)", "UK: 222 min (premiere version)", "USA: 227 min (restored roadshow version)"], "poster": "http://img3.douban.com/lpic/s4034477.jpg", "imdb_url": "http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0056172/", "title": "Lawrence of Arabia", "writers": ["T.E.
