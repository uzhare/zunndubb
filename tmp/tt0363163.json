In Berlin, capital of the Third Reich, Adolf Hitler proclaims that Germany will still achieve victory and orders his Generals and advisers to fight to the last man. \"Downfall\" explores these final days of the Reich, where senior German leaders (such as Himmler and Goring) began defecting from their beloved Fuhrer, in an effort to save their own lives, while still others (Joseph Goebbels) pledge to die with Hitler. Hitler, himself, degenerates into a paranoid shell of a man, full of optimism one moment and suicidal depression the next. When the end finally does comes, and Hitler lies dead by his own hand, what is left of his military must find a way to end the killing that is the Battle of Berlin, and lay down their arms in surrender.", "runtime": ["156 min", "178 min (extended version)"], "poster": "http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/M/MV5BMTM1OTI1MjE2Nl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMTEwMzc4NA@@._V1._SY317_.jpg", "imdb_url": "http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0363163/", "title": "Der Untergang", "writers": ["Bernd Eichinger", "Joachim Fest"], "imdb_id": "tt0363163", "directors": ["Oliver Hirschbiegel"], "rating_count": 139170, "actors": ["Bruno Ganz", "Alexandra Maria Lara", "Corinna Harfouch", "Ulrich Matthes", "Juliane K\u00f6hler", "Heino Ferch", "Christian Berkel", "Matthias Habich", "Thomas Kretschmann", "Michael Mendl", "Andr\u00e9 Hennicke", "Ulrich Noethen", "Birgit Minichmayr", "Rolf Kanies", "Justus von Dohn\u00e1nyi"], "plot_simple": "Traudl Junge, the final secretary for Adolf Hitler, tells of the Nazi dictator's final days in his Berlin bunker at the end of WWII.", "year": 2004, "country": ["Germany", "Austria", "Italy"], "type": "M", "release_date": 20040916, "also_known_as": ["Downfall"]}
